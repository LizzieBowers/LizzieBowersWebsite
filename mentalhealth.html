                        <p>“It’s not that bad” is one of the biggest lies I ever told myself. For years, that was my response every time someone suggested I get help, and, as it turns out, it was that bad. I actively encouraged others to get the help they needed even as I didn’t have a grasp on my struggles because I refused to believe it was “that bad.” I even prepared for and left on a religious mission thinking I only dealt with minor levels of anxiety.</p>
                        <p>I’d known for years what it feels like to be trapped inside your own mind, and had experienced a desperation to do anything to keep away from my own thoughts. But, I also knew that my mind could be a beautiful place that I immensely enjoyed. I was in a good place, though, or so I kept telling myself. </p>
                        <p>I was sent home after 10 days in the mission field because of my mental health. During the time I was there, I discovered that not only did my mind have the capacity to be a darker place than I’d ever experienced, but that it also could rob me of my ability to move and function. To make it worse, I had entered into a new struggle to feel anything besides frustration at my lack of feeling.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Greatest Joy</h2>
                        <p>Despite all of my struggles, I gained a better understanding of what joy really is. The bible and every other book of scripture is full of references to opposites. Good and evil, light and darkness, day and night, joy and pain. Sometimes, to know one thing we must also experience the other. I know summer is hot because winter is cold. If I didn’t have the other to compare to, I’m not sure I would truly understand.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Light and Darkness</span>
                        <p>The same concept applies to my mental health. I didn’t understand how wonderful peace felt until I couldn’t feel it. I fought hard to be able to feel peace and joy again, and when I did, they felt more amazing than they ever had before.</p>
                        <p>To be continued...</p>
