                        <p>Growing up, I knew that my parents liked dancing. It was how my dad first got my mom’s attention, and it was one of my favorite things to watch them do. I wanted to be able to dance, too. So when I started college, the plan was always to take a dance class. Somehow I ended up in a technique class instead of social dance, which was all fine and dandy until I had no idea how to apply the steps I’d learned for a routine into a non choreographed dance.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Break</h2>
                        <p>The semester I took the dance class, I graduated from the small college I attended. I then proceeded to take an 18 month break from school to serve a mission for my church. During this time, I really missed dancing and made plans to take a class when I went back to school. I ended up transferring to a school I didn’t want to, Brigham Young University, and was intimidated by their dancing program. Thankfully, in consulting an academic advisor, I was told to take the social dance course just like I’d planned.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Dancing Queen</h2>
                        <p>Social dance was my favorite class my first semester at BYU. I made a lot of friends and had two hours a week to not think about any of my other classes and how overwhelming they felt. In October, my teacher started preparing us for Dance Sport. We didn’t have to compete, but since I remembered enjoying performing in band in high school, I was all in.</p>
                        <p>My partners and I practiced in preparation, with me particularly enjoying more opportunities to dance. Friday night, I competed in swing, ecstatic that I made it to the second round before being eliminated. Saturday morning, with a different partner, I competed in chacha. I can’t tell you how much fun it was. We made it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Somehow, I managed to convince one of my roommates, who I’m going to call V, to come watch. She took videos and said I was a dancing queen. With going to quarterfinals, I sure felt like it. I’d been trying to talk V and my other roommates into taking a social dance class, but until this point she didn’t seriously consider it.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">If I didn't perform well, I did have fun.</span>
                        <p>I think the point I’m really trying to make here is that I felt like a queen because I let myself have fun, be sassy, and get attention. So often I get into my own head about what I should or should not do that I forget that every now and then it’s okay to act like the queen I know I am. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fun to have moments like those on the dancefloor, but I also think it’s exhausting and detrimental to others to have those.</p>
