                        <p>Every summer the mailbox seems to fill up with student loan and credit card offers, each advertising the benefits of using them to go into debt to pay for school. The offers always use emotional reasons for the now, saying it will make a better future without explaining how. Young adults are barraged with information about finances that is confusing when they don’t have a clear plan for how they’re going to afford going to school or living on their own. Knowing where they stand financially and having a clear plan for the future is important for them to succeed because it will help them know what decisions to make now that will be beneficial in the future.</p>
                        <p>Not all financial planning will be the same, however, some specific things are required for it to be a financial plan. According to Liz Manning in her article Financial Plans: Meaning, Purpose, and Key Components, “A financial plan is a document that details a person’s current financial circumstances and their short- and long-term monetary goals.” (Manning) Knowing the current standing and goals to work towards makes it a plan rather than just vague goals and possibilities.</p>
                        <p>It is important for young adults to make a financial plan because they’re at the point of their lives where they have to figure out how. According to Fidelity in their article What is Financial Planning?, financial planning “also aims to give you a complete picture of where you stand financially and identify changes you may need to make to increase the likelihood of achieving your goals—for example, which account types and financial products make sense for your personal situation.” (Fidelity) Setting goals to work towards is going to require changes for young adults because their life situation has changed. Living the same lifestyle may not work as well when the young adult, instead of their parents, is responsible for figuring out where the money is coming from.</p>
                        <p>Being new to the world of personal finances, young adults don’t always have a complete understanding of what they are getting into. In the same article previously mentioned, Fidelity also states that “A financial plan can also help you uncover vulnerabilities, like not having enough saved in an emergency fund or being underinsured.” (Fidelity) A financial plan helps young adults to see not only their goals, but how to avoid other financial upsets that could prevent them from reaching those goals.</p>

                          </div>
                        <p>The idea behind having a financial plan is to gain a broad understanding of personal finances. Knowing the current standing, which paths to take, and potential obstacles along the path will make financial goals attainable. Making the plans as a young adult is important because it sets up for success from the beginning of the financial journey. The offers in the mail that say “future success” will be studied closer to understand the consequences now instead of when the consequences are happening.</p>
